Instructions for the web scraper "soup.py"

Run as: python soup.py -s "search+terms" [-f ext]
where search+terms is properly formatted google query (using + signs for spaces)
and ext is the file extension being searched for (defaults to "ps")

There is an array called ignore in soup.py to which the user may add the bug numbers being ignored.
There are also variables offset, start and end which may be used in resuming searches and limiting the number of results.

soup.py can only be run from rhombus; other machines have problems with the python version

Instructions for DDFrontEnd.py

Invoke the command as: python DDFrontEnd.py  -i input-file -o output-file [-d bug#] [-r]

input-file is the bug-producing input to be minimalized
output file is where the 1-minimal bug producing input is saved
bug # is the bug number *not* to ignore
-r signals to reiterate until multiple runs do not create a smaller "1-minimal" file
